            <b><p>Not the other way around': SolGen says ICC should give drug war findings to PH</p></b>

            <p>MANILA -- The International Criminal Court (ICC) should submit its drug war findings to the Philippine government and let domestic courts tackle the case, Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said on Tuesday.

                The Philippines has not responded to the ICC's request to aid in its investigation into the drug war of former President Rodrigo Duterte because the country is no longer obliged to help the international investigating agency since it pulled out its membership, Guevarra told state television PTV.</p>

            <p>MANILA — Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III, chief of the police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), on Tuesday said neither Malacañang nor the Senate instructed him to file complaints against Rodrigo Duterte, noting it was the responsibility of the police to pursue charges based on the former president's "killing" remarks.

                Torre on Monday filed complaints for inciting sedition and unlawful utterances against Duterte as part of a "case buildup" before the Department of Justice.</p>

                <p> Microsoft and Volexity have revealed that threat actors with ties to Russia are leveraging a technique known as device code phishing to gain unauthorized access to victim accounts, and use that access to get hold of sensitive data and enable persistent access to the victim environment. At least three different Russia-linked clusters have been identified abusing the technique to date. The attacks entail sending phishing emails that masquerade as Microsoft Teams meeting invitations, which, when clicked, urge the message recipients to authenticate using a threat actor-generated device code, thereby allowing the adversary to hijack the authenticated session using the valid access token.</p>
